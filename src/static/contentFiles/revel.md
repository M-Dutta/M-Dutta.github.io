I lead a team of engineers on projects like overhauling Revel's **Authentication/Authorization**, implementing **Service Discovery**, and streamlining legacy data handlers to boost performance. 

Before I took the role as a lead engineer, I worked with microservices, SPAs, mono-repos, CI/CD Pipelines, and IaC for production deployment via AWS services.
