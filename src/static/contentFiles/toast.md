I worked in a team responsible for developer tools and infrastructure, creating services and tools that act as a force multiplier for the entire R&D engineering org.

I led cross-team initiatives to overhaul tools + infrastructure that have resulted in a 50% reduction in development time and at least $200,000 in cost reduction after early adoption. (Potentially >$750,000 after full adoption.)  

I have also contributed to open-source projects (e.g `OpenApi-diff`) as part of our open-source tooling adoption.
