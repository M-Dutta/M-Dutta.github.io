I worked in a developer platform team, creating the necessary infrastructure and tooling that boosts productivity for the entire R&D engineering org.

I've cross-team initiatives to overhaul tools + infrastructure that have resulted in 
- 50% reduction in development time 
- Potential to reduce cost by up to 75%

I'm currently working on building the next generation of Toast's developer portal by adopting open source [backstage.io](https://backstage.io/)

I have also contributed to open-source projects (e.g. [OpenApi-diff](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff)) as part of our open-source tooling adoption.
