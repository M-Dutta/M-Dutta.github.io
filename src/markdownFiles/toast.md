* Significantly improved in-house development & productivity tools for orchestrating Docker-based service stacks with 350+ active engineers (by 60%) and developed extended features for it.  

* Led multiple cross-team initiatives to create a new productivity tool that scales and speeds up development and testing infrastructure (AWS), resulting in a 100x capacity increase, 50% development time reduction, and a minimum $200,000 cost savings a year. (Potentially >$450,000 after full adoption)  

* Modernized Toast’s testing Cloud Infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines using Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and re-useable Jenkins libraries, reducing E2E testing time by 25% and increasing E2E test adoption.  

* Built observability dashboards using Splunk and Datadog to monitor tools and container health, track service logs, and alert users during degradation.  

* Implemented Gradle tools to verify microservice’s API specs as a part of automation using open-source projects and contributed to some of them (e.g. OpenApi-diff).  

* Developed microservices using REST protocol and messaging queue (pulsar) that tracked internal git metrics.
